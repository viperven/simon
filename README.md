A game called "Project Name Simon" is focused on recalling patterns like "red," "red blue," and "red blue green."

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery were used to create this project.  Feel free to make modifications. 

Project Logic: Compare the index values of each both arrays in the if statement using the first array to store the gamePattern and the second array to store the user-clicked pattern.
